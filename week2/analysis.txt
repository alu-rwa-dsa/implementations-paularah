The time complexity of question 1 is O(n). This based on my research 
on the implementation of the re.sub method(See links in the reference section). The space of complexity of my solution for question 1 is O(n) since the space is constant irrespective of the size. 

The time complexity of solution for question 2 is O(n) and space complexity is O(1)

The time complexity of my solution for question 3 is 0(n^3) 	q	uestion 4 & 5 is O(n^2) while space complexity for all is 0(n) except question 4 which is O(1)
